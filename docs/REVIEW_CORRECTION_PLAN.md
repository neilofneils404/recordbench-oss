# Independent review correction plan

Status: implementation started. Track sections in
[issue #109](https://github.com/neilofneils404/recordbench-oss/issues/109).
R1a.1 implements the first confidence-language mitigation; validation is recorded
in its pull request. Remaining sections stay open until their own evidence passes.

Authoritative planning baseline: GitHub OSS `main` at
`a33d93b5302fc0f726f361ae2e3341883a4bdd77`, verified with `git ls-remote` and
an isolated fresh checkout. This is exactly the external review's commit.
Implementation uses an isolated checkout of that verified upstream revision.
Refresh GitHub and record the actual candidate before each new section, preserving
unrelated local work.

## Objective and evidence boundary

Correct misleading answer confidence, incomplete extraction presented as complete,
unsafe authentication fallback, and source-text failures without weakening
source provenance, privacy, authorization, or recovery. Review retention against
the intended workflow before changing deletion policy.

The external report describes synthetic reproductions in an isolated arm64 Linux
VM/container environment, with an injected generator and a clean-result malware
scanner stand-in. It is useful defect evidence, but is not a supported x86-64
installation, real-model evaluation, scanner acceptance, or GPU acceptance.
The source checkout was current GitHub OSS code; the limitation is the runtime
test environment, not the freshness of that source. Its reproduction package and
logs have not been inspected in this planning pass.
Reported test totals and hosted CI are attributed reports, not new verified results.

A GPU is unnecessary to demonstrate a deterministic verifier accepting supplied
text, a PDF OCR-selection error, a save-handler exception, or an authentication
configuration error. Fix these with reproducible application tests, then validate
the integrated product using the supported installation and model profiles.

Read [architecture](ARCHITECTURE.md), [security](SECURITY_MODEL.md),
[installation](INSTALL.md), [backup and recovery](STORAGE_AND_BACKUP.md), and
[release readiness](RELEASE_READINESS.md). Existing release requirements remain
in force. Keep all fixtures synthetic and all public evidence environment-neutral.
Do not copy operator paths, deployment configuration, identities, logs, or secrets
into this plan, fixtures, or handoffs.

## Triage ledger

The code observations below were checked at the planning baseline. None substitutes
for a current-candidate end-to-end reproduction.

| Track | External finding and current-code evidence | Disposition / initial priority | Completion state |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| R1 / F1 | Meaning-changing claims reportedly pass through `/ask`. `generation._verify_text` still uses term overlap, numbers, quotes and negation; generated lead-ins still say sources support the answer. The research template still says “Verified synthesis.” | High: reproduce; correct confidence contract and source inspection. Measure semantic quality separately. | Open |
| R2 / F2 | A stamped scan reportedly skips OCR and misses a known term. `PilotStore` PDF extraction still selects expanded OCR using a text-strength threshold of 20 and counts nonempty units as searchable pages. | High: reproduce; correct OCR selection and coverage reporting. | Open |
| R3 / F4 | Unset auth reportedly allows passwordless preview access over a container network. Identity and app factories still default to preview; CLI container binding does not check auth mode. Installer doctor does not compare effective auth mode. | Prompt security hardening: verify entry points and impact, then fail closed for installed service operation. | Open |
| R4 / revised F5 | Source control characters reportedly cause a case-note 500, report rejection, and repeated answer failure. `_safe_text` rejects controls; `save_support_notebook` catches `KeyError` but not `WorkspaceProblem`; DOCX serialization only XML-escapes text. | Medium: reproduce save failures; define provenance-preserving text handling and serializer defense. Reachable DOCX corruption is not established. | Open |
| R5 / F3 | Scheduled purge is deliberate. Current maintenance calls `purge_due_matters`; architecture documents a temporary workspace. The review corrected its lifetime claim: the extension horizon rolls forward. | Policy decision plus recovery investigation. Missing automatic export is not itself a defect. | Open |
| R6 | A reported account-cache timestamp test fails on overlayfs but passes on tmpfs. | Security-relevant investigation: determine whether stale authorization is reachable on a supported filesystem. | Open; impact unproven |

## Execution sequence

1. **E0 — Establish reproducible evidence.** Acquire and inspect the external
   scripts/logs outside the tracked tree, or recreate minimal synthetic cases.
   Verify their baseline, fixture provenance, commands and stand-ins. Import only
   reviewed, portable fixtures and regressions. Record a failing-before result on
   the actual candidate for each claimed defect. Preserve unrelated work.
2. **R1a and R3 — Immediate trust and access corrections.** Correct misleading
   confidence language with reachable source inspection; close installed-service
   auth fallback after the configuration matrix establishes the intended boundary.
   Neither depends on GPU availability or a new verifier model.
3. **R2 and R4 — Extraction and saved-work corrections.** Complete each as its own
   reviewable change. Coordinate ownership of ingestion code and citation contracts;
   do not combine text normalization and OCR changes into an unexplained rewrite.
4. **R1b, R5 and R6 — Evaluation and decisions.** Exercise the real model on a
   versioned challenge set, decide retention after reviewing workflow needs, and
   resolve the cache/restore investigations. Start investigation earlier if access
   allows; confirmed security or data-loss defects move ahead of feature work.
5. **E1 — Integrated installation acceptance.** Validate the combined candidate
   through CPU, GPU and applicable recovery lanes below. Record any outstanding
   lane explicitly rather than marking the whole plan complete.

Use one bounded patch per independently reviewable outcome. Product corrections
take precedence over new synthesis/graph features, but this plan does not authorize
deleting those features, broad refactoring, changing model defaults, or weakening
review gates. UI wording/source excerpts must be coordinated with any concurrent
usability work; do not overwrite its templates or styles.

## R1 — Honest answer confidence and inspectable sources

- **R1a.1: confidence presentation** — first correction underway; see
  [generated-answer review](GENERATED_ANSWER_REVIEW.md). Keep claims and stored
  provenance unchanged while warning readers in current and historical views.
- **R1a.2: excerpt comparison** — open. Resolve and display bounded excerpts from
  authorized, exact source references without duplicating full source units in
  saved answer payloads or bypassing source-version checks.
- **R1b: model evaluation** — open. No real-model acceptance follows from R1a.

**Inspect:** `src/case_intelligence/generation.py`, its callers including synthesis,
answer rendering, `templates/workbench_research.html`, saved conversations, Report
conversion and exports. Start with `tests/test_generation.py` and
`tests/test_answer_jobs.py`; expand by reachable consumer, not wording matches alone.
Preserve Continuity C's additional `_exact_original_span` check for opt-in recorded
context; it is stricter than the normal answer path and does not prove general
semantic verification. Cover both paths and their repair/limitation handling.

**Reproduce:** upload synthetic sources and inject generator responses through the
served workbench answer path. Cover approval/rejection, payer/payee reversal,
cross-source stitching, and loss of uncertainty. Include faithful paraphrase,
low-overlap fabrication, explicit negation, numeric/quote errors, and multiple
citations as controls. Inspect both stored results and what a reader sees.

**R1a correction:** describe deterministic checks accurately; do not imply semantic
verification or human approval. Show exact cited excerpts next to, or immediately
accessible from, each claim, with source identity and locator. A displayed excerpt
is cited context, not automatically a supporting sentence. For multiple citations,
show the relevant excerpts separately. Preserve hedges and conflicting evidence.
Apply the same confidence distinction to saved results, synthesis, Reports and
exports; retain historical source basis and reviewer decisions.

**Acceptance:** all four adversarial cases are either rejected or clearly presented
as unverified generated claims requiring source review, never as established facts.
The source contrast is inspectable in the real browser and applicable exports.
Correct paraphrases remain usable. Existing authorization, citation validation,
coverage notices and source-change handling continue to pass. Regression tests
must exercise outcomes; replacing one string alone is insufficient.

**R1b evaluation:** freeze a synthetic challenge set and grading rubric before
running the installed generator, embedding and reranking stack. Record exact model
revisions, prompt/configuration, seeds where supported, and repetitions. Report
generation error separately from verifier false acceptance and false rejection;
include denominators and case-level evidence. Set any release quality threshold
before inspecting results. Do not call the challenge set a production error rate.
Any new semantic verifier or model change needs its own license, offline readiness,
resource and representative evaluation evidence. R1a can be accepted as a mitigation
while R1b remains open; it cannot be recorded as semantic verification solved.

## R2 — Stamped scans and truthful extraction coverage

**Inspect:** `src/case_intelligence/pilot_uploads.py`, PDF extraction metadata,
source registry/index projections, exact search, answer/full-text coverage, and
`tests/test_upload_pilot.py` plus downstream coverage tests.

**Reproduce:** ingest an actual synthetic PDF containing native text, a full-page
scan with a long stamp text layer, a short-stamp scan, and an image-only page.
Use unique known body terms and real bounded OCR, then check page text, exact
search, readiness UI and source viewer. Add mixed native/image regions, logos,
blank pages, rotated pages, existing good OCR, OCR timeout/failure and cap exhaustion.

**Correction:** use bounded page/image evidence as well as extracted-text strength
to select OCR candidates. Design the text-selection or combination rule before
implementation: longer text alone does not establish better extraction. Preserve
valid native text, page locators, originals and extraction provenance; avoid
duplicated text and accidental loss of stamps or body content.

Represent native extraction, OCR attempted/succeeded/failed, skipped limits and
unknown coverage sufficiently to distinguish “searchable text exists” from “all
page content was read.” Carry gaps into Sources, zero-result searches, questions,
full-text review and exports. No heuristic establishes perfect OCR completeness.

**Acceptance:** the stamped body term is found through real ingestion/search;
good native text and citations remain correct; cap/failure cases have visible
coverage gaps. Compare extraction time and resource bounds against the same fixture
set before/after. Test restart and reprocessing. Specify how old sources gain new
coverage information: never silently replace the extraction behind saved citations.
Version/invalidate derived indexes and saved references as required. Any durable
schema/storage change requires backup and clean restore before acceptance.

## R3 — Fail closed in installed authentication

**Inspect:** `identity.py`, the workbench CLI and application factory, Compose
environment defaults, `scripts/recordbench_install.py`, doctor/update/resume,
and local/OIDC/Kerberos authentication tests.

**Reproduce:** from a separate client exercise unset, empty, invalid, preview,
test, local, OIDC and Kerberos configurations; distinguish loopback development
from installed/container operation. Cover CLI and direct application entry points,
fresh install, manual restart and update/resume. Check unauthenticated reads,
identity selection and mutations, CSRF, and matter isolation. Report impact
separately from the likelihood of operator misconfiguration.

**Correction:** require an explicit production auth mode for installed service
operation, including container binding. Development/test bypass must remain
deliberate and unable to become a network-accessible installed fallback. Choose
the enforcement point after tracing every supported launch path. Doctor should
compare expected and effective mode and fail on mismatch without printing secrets
or expanding unauthenticated health disclosures. Do not replace authentication
with a trusted-network assumption or weaken trusted-proxy validation.

**Acceptance:** the network reproduction fails closed for unsafe installed modes;
supported authenticated modes and explicitly isolated development tests still work.
Missing settings cannot create identities or matters remotely. Synthetic browser
sign-in and relevant provider contracts pass on the final candidate. Real provider
acceptance remains a separate installed-node requirement where applicable.

## R4 — Source controls, safe saves and valid exports

**Inspect:** ingestion and persisted passages, `_safe_text`, notebook/Report save
handlers, generation persistence, and `work_product_exports.py`. Begin with
`tests/test_matter_notebook.py`, `tests/test_saved_answer_report_support.py`,
`tests/test_work_product_exports.py` and answer-job tests.

**Reproduce:** admitted synthetic TXT/CSV/email passages containing XML-forbidden
controls, including SUB and ESC; contrast tabs, newlines, form-feed handling and
ordinary Unicode. Trace search → source save, quoted/paraphrased answer → save,
Report creation and all relevant exports. Include older persisted passages.

**Correction:** preserve original bytes/digests. Define a shared, explicit policy
for derived text and presentation, including control replacement, source locators
and normalization provenance. Do not concatenate words by silently deleting
separators, strip all Unicode formatting indiscriminately, or rewrite historical
citations in place. New-ingestion normalization alone cannot repair existing data.
Catch expected validation exceptions and give a useful recovery path rather than
500 or an endless retry suggestion. Apply XML-valid character handling at the
serializer boundary; ordinary entity escaping is not sufficient.

**Acceptance:** valid synthetic passages remain searchable and can be saved with
traceable originals. Unsupported cases receive a controlled, actionable response
without losing a draft. Parse generated DOCX XML and inspect rendered output for
answer, conversation, notebook, Report, bundle, every-source, investigation and
full-text paths that include these passages. Preserve meaning and attribution,
not merely XML well-formedness. Prove existing-data behavior and backup/restore
if persistent text or storage representation changes.

## R5 — Retention policy and recovery safety

**Review:** current creation defaults, rolling extensions, warnings, owner/admin
authority, active-work deferral, purge, manual close and audit retention using
`tests/test_matter_retention_and_themes.py` and backup/closure tests.

Reproduce warnings/grace/purge with a controlled clock and synthetic matter.
Confirm unmanaged originals stay outside deletion. Test extension versus purge,
work finishing during purge, restart, and late workers attempting to save.
Restore an expired synthetic matter into an isolated target with maintenance held
until inspection; then deliberately test maintenance activation and document the
outcome. A repeated purge after restore is currently a hypothesis, not a finding.
Include current Continuity B/C selection and request-receipt state (migrations
0035/0036) in complete-runtime restore and purge checks. Use the matching reader;
never validate rollback by opening upgraded stores with the older local checkout.

**Decision required before policy implementation:** temporary review workspace
versus ongoing case workspace; safe default, extension authority, warning delivery,
and whether scheduled deletion requires confirmation. Compare retaining the current
policy with stronger warnings, opt-in automatic expiry, and no automatic expiry.
Record the chosen outcome and upgrade treatment for existing matters.

Do not automatically write a final bundle as a presumed fix. If selected, define
its authorization, destination, encryption, retention, capacity, failed-export
behavior and eventual deletion; a bundle is not an importable node backup.

**Acceptance:** documented policy and UI match, existing-matter transitions are
explicit, irreversible actions are predictable, and the synthetic recovery drill
does not destroy restored work before operator inspection. Any confirmed recovery
defect gets a bounded correction independently of the broader policy decision.

## R6 — Account cache and filesystem behavior

Reproduce the reported metadata-granularity failure with the actual account writer
and supported storage layouts. Test rapid password, role and enabled-state changes,
including same-size replacement, and ensure old sessions cannot retain revoked
authority. A test passing on tmpfs does not settle behavior on other filesystems.
Classify setup defects separately from reachable stale authentication; fix the
latter promptly if established, preserving bounded account reads and locking.

## Validation lanes and acceptance record

| Lane | What it establishes | Required evidence / limitations |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Local development / isolated Linux VM | Deterministic failures, synthetic HTTP workflows, controlled model outputs, focused regressions | Record OS/architecture, packages, stand-ins and all failed/skipped checks. No GPU or installer readiness claim. |
| Exact-candidate hosted Linux CI | Portable regressions and applicable application, PostgreSQL, browser, deployment and transcription contracts | Record full candidate SHA and actual jobs run. Docs-only skips and parent-commit results are not candidate runtime acceptance. |
| Clean x86-64 Linux CPU installation | Public installer, effective auth, real scanner/OCR, browser → intake/search/save/export, update/restart and diagnostics | Use the public playbook and synthetic data, adequate disk and normal reserve. No mocked scanner or manual environment presented as installer proof. |
| Installed review/GPU profile | Real embedding, reranking and generation behavior, R1b grading, coverage propagation and bounded resources | Exact candidate, model revisions/license records, GPU/VRAM/driver/runtime and synthetic workload; verify offline operation. No extrapolated production accuracy or throughput. |
| Recovery and applicable full profile | Consistent backup, clean restore/rollback, expired-matter handling; transcription/media smoke when affected | Separate original/source state from rebuildable projections. Restore only to isolated targets. Real media/model acceptance is not inferred from a document-only run. |

The installed-node lane uses a separately authorized, isolated validation target;
do not operate an existing deployment or import its state to satisfy this plan.
Where hardware is unavailable, complete portable corrections and explicitly leave
GPU acceptance pending. Model or deployment changes require the applicable lane
before their readiness claim. These receipts do not supersede release readiness.

For each packet, record: owner; full baseline/candidate SHA; fixture version/hash;
commands and environment; expected/actual behavior; failing-before/passing-after
evidence; executed/skipped/failed checks; changed user outcome; migration/rollback;
remaining uncertainty; and reviewer disposition. Use statuses **open → reproduced
→ corrected → locally validated → CI validated → installed acceptance**, with
separate flags for GPU acceptance and policy decisions. “Mitigated” is not “solved.”

Test failures need a specific cause and evidence. Storage-reserve-disabled reruns
are diagnostics, not normal-capacity acceptance. Do not disable the reserve on an
installed node to obtain a green result. Do not waive filesystem failures merely
because another filesystem passes. Run appropriate required suites on the final
combined candidate; do not repeatedly rerun unrelated suites without a reason.

Before any authorized publication, run the installed pre-push publication guard
and separately inspect report text, fixtures and artifact metadata. Follow the
current upstream [public-alpha](PUBLIC_ALPHA.md) policy: Quality and branch
protections always apply; hosted review is optional unless `require-hosted-review`
is enabled. Strict opt-in requires final-head code/security review, reconciliation
and maintainer acceptance. Honor any additional review requirements explicitly
set by the maintainer for this work. Do not change review policy as part of these
fixes. Each implementation section must have its own reviewed change and receipt;
tracking an issue or publishing a draft PR does not establish acceptance.

## Initial evidence and first implementation section

- Verified GitHub `main` matches the external review SHA, then inspected relevant
  implementation paths and architecture/security/installation/recovery contracts
  in the fresh upstream checkout, including the newer recorded-context safeguards.
- External scripts/logs remain uninspected; the first correction uses independently
  written synthetic regressions. All eight initial confidence-presentation checks
  failed against the unchanged reviewed baseline. The four adversarial outputs
  were accepted with the old assurance; legacy views and exports lacked the new
  review notice.
- R1a.1's first focused run passed 73 checks covering generation, new confidence
  regressions, Word/Markdown exports, frozen acceptance-pack integrity and recorded
  context. Final-candidate broader results belong in the PR receipt.
- R1a.2 excerpt comparison, semantic verification improvement, real-model error
  measurement and installed/GPU acceptance remain open. No release readiness or
  deployment claim follows from this first mitigation.
