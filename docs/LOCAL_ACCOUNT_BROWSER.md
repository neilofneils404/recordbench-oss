# Browser account management

An administrator opens **People** from the account menu to create a local
account, change its display name or password, disable/re-enable sign-in, or
change its application role. The first local administrator is directed there
after signing in. The setup checklist explains the next steps: create a
teammate, have them sign in once, create a matter, add them from **Case team**,
and verify their access. Application roles and matter membership are separate.

Renaming an existing account also refreshes its saved name in team and
administrator views immediately, including when that person is offline or
sign-in is disabled. This does not create a principal for someone who has never
signed in, reactivate an inactive principal or change its last-seen time.

Passwords are entered twice and are never redisplayed. Password, state and role
changes end existing sessions at their next request. Removing your own access
requires explicit confirmation and signs you out. The final enabled
administrator cannot be removed. A stale form displays current account data
and asks you to review before retrying.

## New installation

For local accounts, explicitly enable the narrow writable account profile:

```bash
./install --auth local --enable-account-management
```

The installer creates one canonical `accounts/local-accounts.json`, mode `0600`,
inside an owner-only `0700` directory. `compose.local-accounts.yaml` mounts that
directory at `/var/lib/recordbench-accounts` in the app and operator account tool.
The original secrets mount remains read-only in both the app and operator
account tool. No duplicate account database or writable session-key, provider-secret or database-credential mount
is introduced. Installer resume and updates retain this profile in
`installation.json`. New installations must explicitly select local authentication.

The profile requires a local POSIX filesystem with reliable locks, atomic rename
and durable file/directory sync. The account directory may contain only the
canonical account file, its lock file and writer temporary files. Startup and
each browser write check that boundary. Do not put backups or other secrets
there. Without this profile, People explains that an operator must enable it
and links to setup instructions. OIDC and Kerberos installations direct account
changes to the configured identity provider and retain matter-team controls.

## Existing node: explicit stopped-node relocation

Use the service-account identity and the matching reviewed release. All paths
below are generic examples; choose the node's actual paths in the operator
environment. Do not perform this through an HTTP request.

1. Stop the application and every operator account writer. Back up configuration,
   `installation.json`, the account file, control database and session-key
   boundary following [Storage and backup](STORAGE_AND_BACKUP.md).
2. If accounts are version 1, run the separate verified migration in
   [Local account lifecycle](LOCAL_ACCOUNT_LIFECYCLE.md) first.
3. Relocate the same version 2 account file with a new recovery destination:

   ```bash
   recordbench accounts relocate \
     --file /srv/recordbench/secrets/local-accounts.json \
     --destination /srv/recordbench/accounts/local-accounts.json \
     --backup-file /mnt/recovery/recordbench/accounts-before-browser.json \
     --confirm-stopped
   ```

   Run on the host in the reviewed operator environment, or explicitly mount
   these directories into the account tool. The destination directory must be
   empty and `0700`. The command saves and verifies a `0600` recovery copy
   preserving account details with fresh session revisions, writes and syncs
   the new file with independently rotated session revisions, then
   removes and syncs the old canonical file. If interrupted after writing the
   destination, keep writers stopped and inspect both paths before resuming.
4. Set `RECORDBENCH_LOCAL_ACCOUNT_ROOT=/srv/recordbench/accounts` in `compose.env`.
   Set `CASE_INTELLIGENCE_LOCAL_ACCOUNTS_FILE=/var/lib/recordbench-accounts/local-accounts.json`
   and `CASE_INTELLIGENCE_LOCAL_ACCOUNT_MANAGEMENT_ROOT=/var/lib/recordbench-accounts`
   in `config/recordbench.env`. Set `local_account_management` to `true` in
   `installation.json`. Preserve the other configuration fields and owner-only
   permissions. Include `compose.local-accounts.yaml` after `compose.yaml` for
   direct Compose operations; installer operations load it from node metadata.
5. Validate the rendered Compose graph, restart the application, and sign in
   again. Confirm the original secrets mount is read-only in both the app and
   operator account tool. With
   synthetic accounts, create two reviewers, add only one to a synthetic matter,
   confirm only that reviewer can open it, then reset and disable that account
   and confirm its existing sessions lose access.

## Backup, clean restore and rollback

Include the dedicated account directory in the stopped-writer backup boundary.
Restore its canonical file to a new owner-controlled `0700` directory with mode
`0600`, enable the matching profile and configuration, and verify synthetic
administrator sign-in, account mutation and matter authorization. A synthetic
clean restore regression checks that the verified relocation recovery copy is
readable and authenticates the same account. A rollback regression reuses the
original workspace database and signing key, restores without intervening
session requests, and confirms that both pre-move and destination cookies are
denied while fresh password sign-in succeeds; an installed-node recovery drill
remains an operator acceptance requirement.

To roll back the layout, stop all writers and the application. Retain a protected
copy of the latest canonical accounts, restore the pre-relocation recovery file
at the old secrets path with owner-only permissions, remove the management-root
setting and overlay, set `local_account_management` to `false`, and restore the
previous account-file setting. Restart the compatible release and sign in again.
The relocation recovery copy has independent session revisions, so it does not
restore access to cookies issued before the move or at the destination.
Changes after the recovery copy are absent and must be reconciled deliberately.
Never run writers against both locations or copy lock files into a live node.

Rolling back the account **format to v1** is a separate operation. Follow the
[local-account rollback command](LOCAL_ACCOUNT_LIFECYCLE.md#existing-installations-explicit-migration-and-recovery)
under the stopped-writer boundary; the exact v1 migration recovery file has no
independent revisions and must not be restored by raw copy with old sessions.

## Authorization and audit

Browser routes require authenticated administrator access and a valid CSRF
token. Before saving, the shared repository rechecks the actor's current local
session and administrator role under its process writer lock, then compares a
keyed edit token with current account data. Last-administrator protection shares
that lock. Forms have a bounded body size, and concurrent password work is
limited. HTTP requests cannot supply a filesystem path, migrate accounts or
initialize an administrator.

Content-minimized audit events record the authenticated actor, action and an
opaque target identifier. Enable, disable, administrator and reviewer changes
have distinct actions in both the request and completion records. A requested
event must persist before account
replacement; completion is recorded afterward. A completion-audit failure is
reported without pretending the account change was rolled back. A failed saved-name
refresh similarly reports the committed rename and required projection repair.
Both projection refresh and completion audit run while the account writer lock
is held, preventing an older rename from overwriting a later saved name.
Session resolution conditionally refreshes only the name it previously read and
reloads the persisted principal, retaining a newer browser rename. Storage errors
require a fresh read before retrying. Neither event includes passwords, hashes,
session revisions or submitted form bodies.

## Portable synthetic browser acceptance

With the checkout's Python dependencies, Node, OpenSSL and Playwright Chromium
available, run `python scripts/qa-people-browser.py`. Set `PLAYWRIGHT_MODULE` to
an installed `playwright` package if Node cannot resolve it. For installed Chrome,
set `RECORDBENCH_QA_BROWSER_CHANNEL=chrome`. Optional `--artifacts` retains desktop
and narrow screenshots in a directory outside the checkout.

The runner creates a temporary loopback HTTPS node with synthetic accounts and
a test-only zero storage reserve, drives actual browser forms, checks two-user
matter authorization plus reset/disable revocation, then removes the node. Its
certificate exception applies only to that isolated browser context. It never
connects to an existing installation and does not establish production browser
trust, model readiness or installed-node recovery.


When relocation creates a destination or recovery directory, each new parent
entry is synced before account files are written or the previous canonical file
is removed. Directory persistence errors stop the change with the original
account file retained. The same guarantee applies to migration recovery paths.
