# Assistant actions — brief (increment 5, proposed)

Status: **approved October 3, 2026** with the recommended answers below; each
increment (A, B, C) lands in its own PR with hosted code review.
Scope: the matter assistant dock and the Ask page. No schema change in A or B;
C adds one bounded generation mode and needs its own evaluation.

## Outcome

The matter assistant helps a reviewer do the next useful thing, not only quote
sources: it offers actions that fit what is open, every write is a proposal the
reviewer accepts, and everything it drafts stays source-grounded under the same
checks as answers.

## Problems from the synthetic walkthrough

- Reviewers do not know what to ask; the three empty-state prompts ignore what is
  open (a source, an identity, the timeline).
- The assistant only cites. Turning an answer into work (notes, suggestions,
  questions for a witness) means copying text by hand.
- The collapse control is an icon-only chevron (`workbench_assistant.html`), easy to
  miss and unlabelled visually.
- Nothing helps prepare interview or discovery questions from the record.

## What exists today (baseline)

- Dock: ask with a source-set scope, saved chats, job status and recovery, cited
  claims with **Save passage to case notes** (saved as Suggested), and three
  suggested prompts that fill the box without submitting. Open/collapsed state and
  the selected chat are remembered per browser (localStorage).
- Answers: `GroundedGenerationService` asks the model for a fixed JSON shape
  (`answerable`, `claims`, `limitation`, `missing_information`); `_verify_text`
  keeps a claim only if it cites 1–4 passages of one kind, its quotes and numbers
  appear in them, content overlap is at least 60% (45% for transcripts) and no
  negation mismatch is found. Unsupported text is dropped with a notice; one
  repair pass; otherwise the answer is saved as not supported.
- Models: Qwen3.5-4B (portable) and Qwen3.5-9B (quality), pinned revisions,
  Apache-2.0. **No tool or function calling exists anywhere**; the closest analogue,
  the investigation planner, is deliberately limited to fixed-key proposals with no
  tools or scope authority.
- Suggestions inbox (3b), automatic discovery (3a) and the found-dates draft (3c)
  already turn passages into reviewable suggestions without a model.

## Decision 1 — who chooses an action (recommended: the interface)

**Recommended:** actions are offered by the interface from what is open and from
each verified claim; the model only *drafts text* inside the existing grounded
schema. No model-chosen tool use.

- Why: neither configured model has been evaluated for tool selection, and none of
  the codebase uses it. Model-chosen actions would need a new structured schema, a
  representative tool-selection evaluation and possibly a different model — under
  `AGENTS.md` that means an exact revision, license record, offline readiness test
  and evaluation before it can ship. The interface-offered design delivers most of
  the value with none of that risk.
- Alternative (not recommended now): let the model pick from a fixed action list
  via a constrained JSON field, behind evaluation. Revisit after A–C ship.

## Decision 2 — confirmation model

- Every write is a **proposal card**: what will be created, from which passages,
  with **Save** and **Dismiss**. Nothing is saved until the reviewer saves it.
- Everything saved lands **Suggested** (notes) or in the **suggestions inbox**
  (identities, dates); nothing confirms a claim, identity or event.
- Existing authorization, CSRF, matter membership, source guard and audit apply;
  each save records one audit event naming what it created.
- A proposal whose passages changed since it was drafted is refused on save with
  the existing "changed or unavailable" response.

## Decision 3 — grounding

- Drafted statements use the existing claim verification unchanged.
- Drafted *questions* (C) are not factual claims, so they get their own bounded
  check: each question must cite 1–4 passages it is about; any quoted text and
  numbers must appear in them; questions that cite nothing or quote text that is
  not there are dropped with the same omission notice. Wording is reviewer-owned
  once saved.

## Proposed increments (each its own PR, browser acceptance, synthetic tests)

**A. Dock basics (small, no model change).**
- A visible **Close** text button (keep the chevron as an icon beside the label).
- Context-aware suggested prompts. With a ready source open — "Summarize this
  source", "Who and what appears here", "What dates appear here"; choosing one
  first applies the existing **Ask using this source** single-source scope, so the
  question really is about that source. Elsewhere the general prompts remain.
  Prompts still fill the box; they never submit on their own. (As built: the dock
  is not shown on identity or timeline pages, so prompts for those pages are not
  part of A.)
- Keyboard and screen-reader pass on the dock (focus order, names, collapsed tab).

**B. Proposal cards on verified claims (no model change).** Beside the existing
**Save passage to case notes**:
- **Suggest people, things and dates from this passage**: runs the same
  deterministic extractor as automatic discovery on the cited passages and adds
  any new suggestions to the inbox (Suggested, provenance "from an answer's cited
  passage"); shows how many were added and links to the inbox.
- **Open in timeline draft**: when a cited passage contains a found date, link to
  that entry in the 3c draft.

**C. Draft interview or discovery questions (new generation mode).**
- From selected passages or a saved note set: "Draft questions for a witness" or
  "Draft discovery requests about this". Output: up to 8 questions, each citing the
  passages it is about, verified as in Decision 3, shown as a proposal card and
  saved as one Suggested note.
- Needs a fixed synthetic evaluation set meeting the pass bar under maintainer
  decisions below.

Deferred: proposing timeline events (needs an anchor decision, as found in 3c),
model-chosen actions, cross-matter anything.

## Maintainer decisions — October 3, 2026

The maintainer approved the recommendations, preferring usefulness and planning to
adjust after use:

1. **Interface-offered actions** (Decision 1). The model only drafts text inside
   grounded schemas; it does not choose tools.
2. **C is in scope**, after A and B. Pass bar on a fixed synthetic set: at least
   90% of drafted questions cite a relevant passage, and none quotes text that is
   not in its cited passage. The receipt is recorded in C's PR.
3. **Passage-derived suggestions keep their own provenance** in the suggestions
   inbox ("from an answer's cited passage"), distinct from automatic discovery.
4. **No additions or removals** to A–C for now.

## Acceptance (per increment)

Synthetic regressions for every write path (proposal → save → audit; changed
passage refused; dismissed proposal saves nothing), the dock journeys at phone and
desktop widths with no overflow, keyboard-only operation, and for C a recorded
evaluation receipt on the synthetic set. Hosted code review and maintainer
acceptance as for every PR.
