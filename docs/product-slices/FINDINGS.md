# Findings behind the portable product slices

Checked September 8, 2026 against upstream `main` at
`26f5ece14871ba9312c9aeaf87d42b47edff3022`. These are code-level findings and
bounded synthetic observations from that checkout, not a deployed-system audit
or a fresh-host installation qualification. Source locations and the validation
section below refer to that revision unless a later note says otherwise.

Live implementation status as of September 12, 2026 against the verified `main` snapshot
`c1ada89bf15ea8f61906de3c62202da4d98e279f` lives in the
[exit-alpha cruise](../EXIT_ALPHA_CRUISE.md) and [slice index](README.md); it is
not a re-run of the September 8 inspection. Since that checkout, reusable team
groups (**06**), evidence-driven investigation (**11**), and full-text review
(**12**) exist; hierarchical synthesis (**13**) landed in
[#73](https://github.com/neilofneils404/recordbench-oss/pull/73).
Slices **16 → 18** are Next.

## Installation and onboarding

The installer exists and creates the first local administrator through
`accounts init`; it is incorrect to describe initial administrator creation as
absent. The adoption gap is the surrounding prerequisite and first-team journey.
`docs/INSTALL.md` requires a dedicated non-root account, storage ownership,
Docker/Compose, TLS/authentication decisions, optional model/GPU staging, and
operator acceptance. That is substantial work for an unfamiliar person.

Account management is described as a tools-container CLI operation in
`docs/AUTHENTICATION.md`. `admin_cli.py` implements init/add/password/list.
`LocalAccountSettings` loads the file into memory, and `compose.yaml` mounts
secrets read-only in the application. At that checkout, new account UI therefore
needed a real write/refresh/revocation design, not just forms. On current `main`,
slices **04** and **05** provide that lifecycle and browser People administration;
see [local account lifecycle](../LOCAL_ACCOUNT_LIFECYCLE.md) and
[browser account management](../LOCAL_ACCOUNT_BROWSER.md).

`templates/workbench_admin.html` labels principals as domain users and says
roles are managed by AD security groups without selecting copy by auth mode.
`templates/workbench_setup.html` is Sources/matter setup, not first-run system
onboarding. On current `main`, slice **03** adds first-administrator team setup.
Matter membership UI exists for known principals. Application team
groups with their own matter grants were not found in the inspected September 8
paths. On current `main` they exist as slice **06**; see
[team groups](../TEAM_GROUPS.md).

Implementation: [01](01-install-prerequisites.md),
[02](02-install-handoff-and-recovery.md), [03](03-first-run-onboarding.md),
[04](04-local-account-lifecycle.md), [05](05-browser-account-management.md),
and [06](06-team-groups.md).

## Boolean and exact search

Three relevant paths have different purposes and semantics:

| Path | Observed behavior | Consequence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Sources catalog filter | `_source_catalog_filter` uses a substring of its search key | This is not the same as a content query with Boolean operators |
| CPU workbench retrieval | `InMemoryHybridBackend.lexical` scores any shared tokens; deterministic dense fallback also requires overlap | AND, phrase, and exclusion syntax is not enforced |
| Learned retrieval | PostgreSQL lexical FTS plus pgvector, fused and reranked | A lexical constraint is not a constraint on all fused results |

`PostgresHybridBackend.lexical` uses `websearch_to_tsquery('english', ...)` on
chunk vectors. PostgreSQL documents quoted phrases, `or`, and dash negation;
other punctuation is ignored, and this function does not accept prefix labels
or the full `tsquery` syntax. It normalizes/stems according to the text-search
configuration. See the official
[PostgreSQL 17 search-control documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/17/textsearch-controls.html).
That is not a product-level Boolean grammar with parentheses, proximity,
wildcards, and field semantics.

`HybridRetriever.search` unions the lexical and dense lanes. In learned mode,
semantic-only candidates can remain when dense/rerank scores clear 0.72/0.80.
There is no post-fusion Boolean predicate enforcing a lexical exclusion.
Additionally, lexical matching occurs per chunk, so document-level AND/NOT
across different pages needs a separately defined implementation.

Run the [synthetic probe](probe_search.py) from the repository root:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=src python docs/product-slices/probe_search.py
```

Observed CPU fallback examples used four synthetic texts: `red bicycle`,
`blue bicycle`, `red truck`, and `the bicycle is not blue`.

* `red AND bicycle` returned all four texts.
* `bicycle -blue` returned blue-containing texts as well as `red bicycle`.
* `"red bicycle"` returned nonphrase matches.
* A controlled split-lane backend demonstrated that a semantic-only
  blue-containing candidate can survive even when the lexical lane omits it.
* A request for 30 results from 50 matching candidates returned 20.

The split-lane experiment tests the production fusion logic with controlled
backend/reranker scores. It is not a real PostgreSQL or learned-model execution.
The script reports observations; its current outputs are defects to address,
not acceptance expectations to preserve.

Implementation: [07](07-exact-search-grammar.md),
[08](08-complete-exact-search.md), [09](09-advanced-search.md),
and the explicit limit contract in [10](10-review-budget-visibility.md).

## Deep review

The table records bounds observed at the September 8 checkout. On current
`main`, slice **11** follows evidence with additional searches inside a budget,
and slice **12** reviews every eligible extracted unit. Slice **13** now
synthesizes saved findings through issue and matter groups with original
citations. The final twelve-passage reselection in the historical table is
superseded for new investigations; the per-call generation limits remain.

| Stage | Observed bound or behavior | Source |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Default investigation plan | Up to five preset question variants | `workbench.py::_research_plan` |
| Lexical and dense lanes | At most 100 candidates per lane | `review_bench_v2.py::HybridRetriever` |
| Reranking | At most 40 fused candidates | Same class |
| Returned candidates | At most 20, even when caller requests 30 | `HybridRetriever.search` |
| Per-pass selected evidence | At most 12 passages | `_process_research_job` |
| Evidence ledger | Capacity 72; five default passes can contribute at most 60 unique selected passages before overlap | `_process_research_job` |
| Final synthesis | At most 12 reselected passages; saved pass narratives are not themselves synthesized as a structured findings set | `_process_research_job` |
| Generator evidence | 12 items, 6,000 characters per item, 48,000 characters total | `generation.py` |
| Standard answer output | 1,200 output tokens | `generation.py` HTTP generator request |
| Every-source classification | At most 12 selected passages within each frozen source | `_process_review_decision` |

These are selection/resource boundaries, not proofs of recall. The stored
candidate count accumulates returned passages across passes and is not a unique
document count. Modality-specific supplemental searches can add work; five
default plan passes should not be described as an absolute total of all internal
retrieval calls.

The every-source path correctly keeps a no-match source unresolved instead of
equating zero hits with exclusion. At that checkout, its unit coverage still
depended on selecting passages, so a completed source population was not a
completed all-page read. On current `main`, **Review all extracted text**
covers every eligible unit in a frozen population (slice **12**); selected-passage
screening remains a separate mode. Cross-source hierarchical synthesis is now
implemented as slice **13**, with the evaluation limits recorded in
[HIERARCHICAL_SYNTHESIS.md](../HIERARCHICAL_SYNTHESIS.md).

Implementation: [10](10-review-budget-visibility.md),
[11](11-evidence-driven-investigation.md), [12](12-full-text-review-coverage.md),
and [13](13-hierarchical-synthesis.md). Slices **11**, **12** and **13** exist on
the verified slice-13 `main` snapshot. Synthesis consumes persisted findings
through bounded issue and matter groups, preserving original support through
the intermediate records.

## Why Reports can feel insubstantial

At the September 8 checkout, reports assembled text and cited material and did
not automatically turn a purpose into a well-developed analysis.
`research_to_report` stored the final summary and citations in one section. It
did not turn the saved gaps, passes, and coverage into report sections.
`full_review_to_report` mainly stored the criterion, counts, validation count,
and citations from machine-included decisions. Its cited-detail list stopped at
100 entries. On current `main`, slices **14** and **15** preserve review basis
and compile saved work into drafts; see
[report review basis](../REPORT_REVIEW_BASIS.md) and
[report compilation](../REPORT_COMPILATION.md). Hierarchical cited synthesis
landed as **13**, with original support retained through issue and matter groups.

At the September 8 checkout, the report's evidentiary appendix could be longer
than its reasoning while the answer was constrained by the final 12-passage
packet and short-answer output. That was an inference from the then-current
conversion and generation paths; no private or real user report was reviewed.
New investigations on the landed slice-13 snapshot use section-sized calls
and combine verified matter sections. Their explicit budgets and partial states
remain limits on coverage, not proof of whole-matter recall.

Current upstream already includes saved Reports in complete matter bundles:
`docs/REPORT_EXPORTS.md`, `reports_for_final_bundle`, and
`tests/test_reports_bundle.py` establish that implementation. Do not repeat the
older checkout's claim that saved Reports are omitted. Inclusion/export repair
and analytical usefulness are separate work.

At inspection, open [PR #32](https://github.com/neilofneils404/recordbench-oss/pull/32)
covered final-export readiness and links to Reports needing repair. Recheck its
state and avoid overlapping that work. Slices [14](14-report-review-basis.md)
and [15](15-purposeful-report-outlines.md), together with hierarchical cited
synthesis [13](13-hierarchical-synthesis.md), are on the verified main snapshot.

## People, Places, and Things

`suggest_notebook_references` uses title-based person patterns, selected place
patterns, and dates. It examines at most 2,500 units with at most 6,000 characters
per unit and creates at most 75 new suggestions by default. Label-based
deduplication avoids repeated notes, but does not build all mentions of an
entity. `matter_analysis.py` also has a 2,500-unit and 150-finding bound.

The review map is a Work product subpage and sends entity management to notes.
Its shared-reference comparisons and simple negation comparisons are candidate
leads, not a mature entity-resolution or relationship system. Moving the
navigation alone would leave the data/coverage limitations intact.

Implementation follows deeper review: [16](16-entity-workspace.md),
[17](17-entity-extraction.md), and [18](18-evidence-backed-relationships.md).
Retain what already works: exact support, suggested/confirmed/disputed states,
and the ability for a human to correct machine output.

## External assessment: what is and is not established

A supplied external assessment expressly reviewed README/repository structure,
not the complete code. Its useful observations align with real components:
received-byte matching, intake receipts, malware scanning, timestamped media,
hybrid retrieval, cited answers, and encrypted backup tooling.

Two claims need narrower language. Exact received-byte groups preserve separate
source occurrences; they do not themselves perform deduplication or establish
that one review covers every occurrence. Intake receipts record selection and
transfer/processing states; that alone does not establish complete custody or
security compliance. See `docs/EXACT_BYTE_MATCHES.md` and
`docs/INTAKE_RECEIPTS.md`.

No evidence about another system's code, workload, operating history, or
comparative quality was supplied for independent verification. The assessment
therefore cannot establish that another system is more hardened or scales
better. Hosting location alone does not establish those outcomes. No private
system description or attached document is copied into this repository.

## Validation performed and remaining limits

The checks below are the September 8 inspection at
`26f5ece14871ba9312c9aeaf87d42b47edff3022`, not a revalidation of current `main`.

* Inspected that checkout's installer/authentication, retrieval/orchestration,
  generation, report conversion/export, notebook/analysis, and source UI paths.
* Ran the bounded search probes described above.
* Ran six existing focused suites: retrieval v2, research/full review, Report
  conflicts, Report bundles, OSS installer, and identity/membership. Result:
  113 passed, 11 failed on this development host.
* Three failures involved the Linux-oriented PDF helper: direct reproduction
  showed `resource.setrlimit(RLIMIT_AS, ...)` raising `ValueError` before
  extraction on the host. This is not a reason to remove parser containment.
* Other failures initially returned insufficient storage: the configured
  default reserve is 100 GiB. Reran the research and bundle suites with reserve
  zero only in the isolated synthetic test process: 40 passed, one media-upload
  test still returned HTTP 400. That remaining media failure was not diagnosed
  as an application defect in this audit.
* No production settings were changed. No clean-host install, real PostgreSQL
  integration run, real-model quality evaluation, full browser audit, or
  million-document benchmark was performed here.
* On the documentation branch, the existing OSS installer, identity/membership,
  and Report-conflict suites passed all 64 tests. The saved search probe ran
  against the checked upstream code and reproduced the documented observations.

These checks support the specific findings. They are not a green release gate.
Slice 00 establishes reusable product examples; each implementation must add
the applicable target-environment and end-to-end evidence before completion.
