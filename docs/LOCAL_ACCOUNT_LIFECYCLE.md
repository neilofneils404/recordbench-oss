# Local account lifecycle

Local-account changes use one owner-authorized repository shared by the operator
CLI and future authenticated handlers. This release adds the persistence and
session foundation; browser account editing is a separate product step.

## Persistence and authority

Keep `local-accounts.json` in the existing secrets directory, owned by the
application service account with mode `0600`. Its directory must belong to that
account and cannot be writable by other users. Use a local POSIX filesystem
with reliable advisory locks, atomic rename and durable file/directory sync.
The web application's secrets mount remains read-only. Only the operator's
existing tools container can mutate accounts. No web route, write mount, proxy
exception, default account or authentication bypass is introduced.

`LocalAccountRepository` provides initialize, create, display-name change,
password change, enable/disable and administrator-role change operations.
The caller supplies an action attribution; the CLI identifies its effective
service-account UID and prints a content-minimized completion receipt. Receipts
contain action, account name and actor, never passwords, hashes or session
revisions. A future browser caller must first authorize an administrator,
validate CSRF and record its authenticated principal in the existing audit
system. Possessing a repository object does not supply that authorization.

Each writer holds a persistent owner-only sibling lock file across a fresh
read, validation, mutation and atomic replacement. The last enabled
administrator check shares that lock, so independent writers cannot both
remove the last administrator or overwrite each other's changes. Writers
validate the complete candidate before publishing it, sync the temporary file,
replace it and sync the directory. Never remove a live lock file, edit the JSON
by hand or mix this service with older writer tools.

Readers open bounded regular files through directory descriptors without
following symlinks. They do not create locks or write probes. Each login and
session resolution reopens the path and checks directory ownership plus file
type, owner, mode and size. A process retains one immutable validated snapshot
keyed by directory/file identity, size and nanosecond modification/change times.
Unchanged files avoid JSON parsing and validation of all accounts on every
protected request. Atomic replacement or metadata/content changes trigger a
bounded reload; concurrent in-place changes detected during a read are refused.
Readers never cache failures or fall back to an older snapshot. Missing, unsafe
or malformed files deny access and clear the cache. Changes therefore reach
running processes without restart, including those made by another process.
A write failure before replacement preserves the old account file; a directory
sync error after replacement leaves the commit's durability uncertain. Inspect
account state before retrying an operation after a storage error.

## Session behavior

Version 2 adds a random revision to each account. Password changes, enable/
disable operations and role changes rotate that account's revision. Existing
sessions are denied on their next request, even if an account was disabled and
re-enabled, or demoted and promoted, before that request. Users sign in again
to receive the new state. Display-name changes refresh visible identity without
ending sessions. Unrelated accounts retain their sessions.

The opaque local session cookie carries a keyed binding to the account's
revision and credential/role state; it exposes no password hash or stored
revision. SQLite still stores only the token digest in its existing session
schema. Sessions issued by older releases require sign-in again after this
upgrade. A request already authorized before an account change is not cancelled
mid-flight. OIDC and Kerberos retain their existing provider and trusted-proxy
boundaries.

## Existing installations: explicit migration and recovery

Version 1 files remain readable for sign-in and listing. Mutation refuses them
until the operator makes an explicit verified recovery copy:

```bash
recordbench accounts migrate \
  --file /srv/recordbench/secrets/local-accounts.json \
  --backup-file /mnt/recovery/recordbench/accounts-before-v2.json
```

Run this in the approved operator environment with the correct mounted paths.
The destination must be new and protected. Migration copies the exact version 1
bytes, syncs them, reads them back and validates their account data before
atomically replacing the live file with version 2. It preserves account names,
display names, Argon2id hashes, enabled flags and administrator roles. Migration
ends existing local sessions at their next request. Newly initialized nodes use
version 2 directly.

Back up accounts with the existing configuration, control database and session
key boundary in [Storage and backup](STORAGE_AND_BACKUP.md). Stop all operator
account writers during a consistent snapshot, including the tools container;
stopping only the web application does not stop separate CLI processes.

A clean restore must place the account file in a new owner-controlled directory,
restore mode `0600`, start the matching reviewed release, and verify synthetic
sign-in plus administrator recovery. To roll back to a release that understands
only version 1, stop account writers and the application, restore the exact
pre-migration recovery copy at the original path with its original ownership
and mode, and restart the previous release. Later account changes are absent
from that older copy; reconcile them deliberately before opening access.
Never strip revision fields from the live file to force an older reader to load
it. Keep the migration recovery copy until the rollback window closes.

Synthetic regression tests cover process writers, last-admin races, failed
writes, concurrent readers, fresh process snapshots, revocation and non-revival,
backup verification, clean restore and exact version 1 rollback. A near-limit
500-account fixture verifies that repeated session resolutions parse only once;
replacement, metadata changes and invalid-file tests verify cache invalidation.
These tests do
not replace an operator's installed-node backup and recovery drill.
